    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In this homework, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this homework, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimize overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "We've tried our best to filter the data for anything blatantly offensive as best as we can, but unfortunately there may still be some examples you may find in poor taste. If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

Otherwise, if the feature can take on many values, it makes sense to compare the distribution under spam to the distribution under ham. Create a *class conditional density plot* like the one below (which was created using `sns.distplot`), comparing the distribution of a feature among all spam emails to the distribution of the same feature among all ham emails. You should use your training set (after splitting). **You may use the length of the email body or create your own feature.** If using length of the email body, please set the xlim to 50000.\n",

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent you from overfitting to the test set, you may only upload predictions to Kaggle twice per day. This means you should start early and rely on your **validation data** to estimate your Kaggle scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject / body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number / percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer in order to create features. However, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models and their regularized forms**. This means no random forest, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not give you a code skeleton to do this, so feel free to create as many cells as you need in order to tackle this task. However, answering questions 7, 8, and 9 should help guide you.\n",

    "I plotted a heatmap to visualize the correlation between some of the most common words related to html tags. The color of each square in the grid represents how frequently the two corresponding words appear together in the same email. For example, the same word ('html' and 'html') are the same and will always appear in the same email 100% of the time. However, 'html' and 'font' will only appear together about 50% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that many of these features other show up together, and are actually more likely to occur with each other than with 'html' (darker color/lower probability for html and each word, light color/higher probability for non-html words with other non-html words).\n",
    "\n",
    "if both html and a word related to html help with identifying different spam emails, then having both would help our model.\n",
    "However, if html and a different related word appear in the same emails, including both words as features doesn't help our model."

    "# Question 9 (Making a Precision-Recall Curve)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can trade off between precision and recall. In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precision-recall curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, [plot a precision-recall curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html#plot-the-precision-recall-curve) for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle)."
